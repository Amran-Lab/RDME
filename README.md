### Brief

The Brief was to create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functioning website made by flask and deployed by Jenkins. The website must also have a minimum of two tables in a relational databases.

I decided to create a website where users can post movie and game reviews. This would be the create part of CRUD. For the read functionality I would let users be able to see reviews of their own and other people's reviews. Update would work by editing a review that already exists and delete will be able to delete both records and users.

### ERD

I have created 4 tables excluding the user table. The four tables are paired up with one of each pair being connected to the accounts table, meeting the requirements for the relational database.

### Trello and Planning

For my planning I used Trello. I have moved over tasks when completed to done or when something is ongoing such as the readme it is in the doing tab. I also have a tab of
for the user stories and requirements, to make sure I am meeting the requirements.

### Deployment

Program will be coded in vscode using python-flask and version controlled on GitHub. When changes are made a trigger will cause Jenkins to build the program with the latest version. This will be ran on a GCP Virtual Machine which will be connected to a GCP MYSQL database.

### Retrospective

I have created a flask application and deployed it onto a virtual machine with jenkins,
using Agile methodology. The application can connect to a gcp database and read write to it.
If I was to have more time or do it again I would allow functionality to users to be able to log in with a password, for a layer of authentication and security.

What Went Well
4 tables excluding the user table with two pairs of relation​

Good use of Jenkins, making it build on new GitHub version of the app​

Good Time Management​

Easy to use graphical interface

What could be better

A login feature​

Selenium Testing​

Add more games and movies for user to review​

Write code in a way that is more easier to test
